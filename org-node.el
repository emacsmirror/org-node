A title like \"L√∂b's Theorem\" becomes \"lobs-theorem.org\".
Note that while diacritical marks are stripped, it retains
Unicode symbols classified as alphabetic or numeric, so for
example kanji and Greek letters remain.

As a surprise, it does NOT preface the name with a timestamp like
many zettelkasten packages do.  If you want that, you can use
a small wrapper such as:

In simple terms, let's say you have configured

targets `(function org-node-capture-target)'.  Now here's a
possible workflow:

1. Run M-x org-capture
2. Select your template
3. Type name of known or unknown node
4a. If it was known, it will capture into that node.
4b. If it was unknown, it will create a file-level node and then capture
    into there.

Additionally, if you've set (setq org-node-creation-fn #'org-capture),
commands like `org-node-find' will outsource to org-capture when you
type the name of a node that does not exist.  That enables this
\"inverted\" workflow:

1. Run M-x org-node-find
2. Type name of an unknown node
3. Select your template
4. Same as 4b earlier."

  "Extract subtree at point into a file of its own.
Leave a link in the source file, and show the newly created file.

You may find it a common situation that the subtree had not yet
been assigned an ID nor any other property that you normally
assign to a proper node.  Thus, this creates an ID for you if
there was no ID, copies over any inherited tags, and runs
`org-node-creation-hook'.

Adding to that, see below for an example advice that copies any
inherited \"CREATED\" property, if an ancestor has such a
property.  It is subjective whether you'd want this behavior, but
it can be desirable if you know the subtree had been part of the
source file for ages so that you see the ancestor's creation-date
as more \"truthful\" than today's date.

Requires GNU R installed, with R packages tidyverse and igraph.

A feedback arc set is a set of links such that if they are all
cut (though sometimes it suffices to reverse the direction rather
than cut them), the remaining links in the network will
constitute a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

You may consider this as merely one of many ways to view your
network to quality-control it.  Rationale:
