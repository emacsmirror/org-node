;;; Commentary:

;; I rename things a lot.  That would break things for users unless I make
;; aliases.

;; But `define-obsolete-variable-alias' does not warn users about
;; user options, which means they can blissfully keep referring to a
;; thrice-deprecated variable name for years and not know.

;; Thus this file.  Actually tell the user, once, for each old symbol that
;; they set or call.
